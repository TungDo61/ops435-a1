Algorithm for Assignment 1 

(1) The script accept minimum of 2 arguments. First being a date in the YYYY/MM/DD format,
    second item is an number and an optional third argument being --step

(2) The number of arguments should be check and give a usage instruction if it is less
    than 2 or more than 3. Arguments are also checked to see if they're entered in the 
    correct format: YYYY/MM/DD for the first, an interger for the second

(3) Take the first argument and seperate them by the "/" to get the year, month and date

(4) After function will take the day and increase it by 1, if the day is the last day of the
    month then set the day to 1 and increase the month by 1. If the increased month 
    exceed 12 then set it to 1 and increase the year by 1. 
    Leap years are taken into consideration

(5) Before function will take the day and decrease it by 1, if the day is 1 then set 
    the day to the last day of previous month and decrease the month by 1. If the decreased 
    month reach 0 then set it to 12 and decrease the year by 1. 
    Leap years are taken into consideration
    
(6) Depend on whether or not the number argument is positive or negative, the program will call
    the before or after script the correct number of time and print the final date.

(7) if there is an optional argument of "--step", remove "--step" from the list and print 
    the correspondent before or after function each time until it reach the number entered
