Algorithm for Assignment 1 

(1) The script accept minimum of 2 data items. First being a date in the YYYY/MM/DD format,
    second item is an number and an optional third item being --step

(2) The number of arguments should be check and give a usage instruction if it is less
    than 2 or more than 3. Arguments are also checked to see if they're entered in the 
    correct format: YYYY/MM/DD for the first, an interger for the second

(3) Take the first argument and seperate them by the / to get the year, month and date

(4) There are two scripts that will give the day before or after of the date given.
    Leap year will be taken into consideration to give the correct date.
    
(5) Depend on whether or not the number argument is positive or negative, the program will call
    the before or after script the correct number of time.
